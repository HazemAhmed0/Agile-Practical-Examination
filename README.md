# WHAT'S POPPIN
## The #1 platform for finding and sharing activities and places around you

Our service aims to provide users with a platform to find and share activities surrounding them. For the days when you just don’t know what to eat, or when you’re new in town and only staying for a few days. Our service will help you make the most out of your time. Users are also encouraged to share their small businesses on our app and your new café might just be the #1 spot in town if it catches on.

# Near Vision

* In sprint #2 we aim to have developed a simple interface to add a "spot" and save it to database
